### Description
This is the repository containing code samples, tutorials, and project starters for the Intro to Computer Programming course at Nueva Upper School.

## Developer Environment Setup
We will be programming in Python this semester, a general purpose programming language that is used for building websites, automating tasks, and data analysis, among other things. We will be using a variety of libraries written in Python, which are collections of prewritten Python code that we can use to make large tasks easier, like [drawing with p5](https://github.com/morgansierrasnyder/intro_to_computer_programming#project-1-drawing-with-p5) for our first project.

Let's start by preparing your computer to run programs using the latest version of Python! \
‚ö†*These directions assume that you have learned basic commands in Terminal, which are covered in [these slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CojhIzUy_x16zoKOE_BFhZST0xzP3eFsVbdQRhcbuCk/edit?usp=sharing) or you can look at [this cheatsheet](https://github.com/0nn0/terminal-mac-cheatsheet#core-commands) as a refresher.*

1. **Download a code editor!** Go to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and follow the installation instructions. A code editor is like a programmer's iron man suit - It's a text editor with a bunch of special tools programmers.
2. **Install Homebrew.** Homebrew is a package manager for Mac - it's like your personal code librarian. Instructions are also here: https://brew.sh/
   1. Open your Terminal (command + Space then type Terminal)
   2. Copy and paste the following in your Terminal `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"` then hit Return
   3. Enter your password and hit Return (heads up - your password will not show up when you type üôÉ)
   4. Hit Return again (don't abort üò∏)
   5. When Homebrew is done installing, you should see instructions to add the `% brew` command to your Terminal's path. Run the following command in your Terminal ‚ùóüõë Replace `<your username>` with YOUR username before you copy and paste the following üõë‚ùó : `echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/<your username>/.zprofile
    eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"` and hit Return
3. **Quit and Restart your Terminal**
4. **Install Python 3**
   1. `brew install pyenv` install pyenv to manage different Python *env*ironments
   2. `brew install xz` install xz supporting library
   3. `pyenv install 3.10.6` install python 3.10.6 using pyenv 
   4. `pyenv global 3.10.6` set 3.10.6 to the default on your computer
   5. `echo -e 'if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then\n  eval "$(pyenv init -)"\nfi' >> ~/.zshrc` to allow pyenv to control the python version during every terminal session. üõë‚ùó If you get a "file not found" warning for ~/.zshrc, create the file first with `touch ~/.zshrc` then run this command again
   6. `source ~/.zshrc` to apply your new settings
5. **Verify that things work!**
   1. Run `python --version` in your Terminal. You should see that Python 3.10.6 (or higher) is being currently used
   2. Run `brew help` in your Terminal. You should see the documentation of all brew commands!
   3. Look at [Troubleshooting](###Troubleshooting) below if these commands are not working as expected

#### Troubleshooting
```zsh: command not found: brew```
You need to add the `brew` command to your path, so that Terminal recognizes it! Run this in Terminal, after your replace `<your username>` with YOUR laptop's username:
```
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/<your username>/.zprofile
    eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```
\

`/nofile.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory`
Make sure you are in the directory that your code lives in! You can use `cd <Directory name>` to go to another Directory in your current folder, or `cd ..` to move up a level in the file hierarchy.
\

`no_lzma`
Try `brew install xz`. After that, you can uninstall and reinstall your Python version by running `brew uninstall <desired python version>` and `<brew install <desired python version>`
    
## Project 1: Drawing with p5

We'll use p5 for our first project. This library is used for creating visual graphics. Some of you might be familiar with Processing, a visual graphics library in Javascript, and p5 was in fact originally built in Javascript using Processing as a foundation before being translated to Python!

Let's get started by installing p5 on your machine. If you haven't followed the steps to install Homebrew and Python in the [Developer Environment Setup](https://github.com/morgansierrasnyder/intro_to_computer_programming#developer-environment-setup) steps, do that **first**!

### Installing p5
Open your Terminal. Run the following commands by typing them in Terminal, then hit Return.
1. `python --version` this should return `3.10.6`
2. `pip install --upgrade pip` to make sure you're on the latest version of the python package installer
2. `pip install numpy` This installs the latest version of numpy, which is a dependency for p5
3. `pip install freetype-py glfw==2.5.4 pillow requests skia-python` This installs most of the dependencies that come after numpy
4. `pip install pyopengl`
5. `pip install vispy --use-deprecated=legacy-resolver` If this fails, run `pip install cython` and try again!
6. `pip install p5==0.8.0 --no-deps`
7. **Test out that it works!** The p5 library offers many test examples that you can try out [here](https://github.com/p5py/p5-examples) - Bookmark it!
   1. Copy the code from [snake.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p5py/p5-examples/master/misc/games/snake.py)
   2. Create a new file in your Terminal `vim snake.py`
   3. Paste the code into the new snake.py file
   4. Hit "esc" and close by typing ":wq" and hitting Return
   5. Run the program by running `python3 snake.py` in Terminal
   6. You should get a popup window with the game - hit an arrow key on your keyboard to play!

## Writing and running your first p5 program

#### Write your program
1. Create a new file in your code editor by going to **File > New** in the top bar or pressing **‚åò(command) + N**. Save the file in your Development folder and call it `something.py` or `whateveryouwant.py` - Just sure it has the `.py` at the end so your computer knows it's written in Python.

Every p5 program follows this recipe:
```
from p5 import *     # this line imports all of the code from the p5 library

def setup()          # the setup function runs once
   #ADD CODE HERE to define settings such as canvas size, fill color, etc.

def draw()           # the draw function runs every frame (~ 60 times per second!)
   #ADD CODE HERE to draw things on the canvas
   
run()                # the run function begins the program, first calling setup() then starts the draw() loop
```
2. Inside your file, copy and paste the p5 boilerplate above and add your own code to the `setup()` and `draw()` functions.

You can reference the [p5 documentation](https://p5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/index.html) or look at some of the [p5 code examples](https://github.com/p5py/p5-examples) for ideas.

#### Run your program
1. Open Terminal. Use your `cd` and `ls` commands to navigate to the directory that your p5 code is saved in.
2. Run the Python program `python3 replace_me.py`
3. Terminate the program by pressing **Ctrl + C** or closing the p5 graphics window. You can also press **‚åò(command) + T** to open a new Terminal tab and run your program there (So many p5 windows WOW!)

#### Troubleshooting
`NameError: name 'x' is not defined` you are trying to use a variable before you've declared it. add a line to your code before you use `x` that declares its value, such as `x = 42` or `x = "my string"`. \
`IndentationError: expected an indented block` make sure that you've added code underneath `def setup()` and `def draw()` that is indented. if you're still getting the error, check that the code beneath your `if`, `elif` and `else` statements is indented, check that the code beneath your `for` and `while` loops is indented, check everywhere!

## Project 2: Graphical User Interface (GUI) with Tkinter

For our second project, you'll create a GUI using Tkinter, a Python library with lots of visual widgets (buttons, form fields, labels, and more) to use as building blocks for designing a user interface.

### Install Tkinter
1. Open Terminal
2. Check your version of Python `python3 --version` (or `python --version` if you aliased python='python3' when doing your [developer environment setup](https://github.com/morgansierrasnyder/intro_to_computer_programming#developer-environment-setup)
3. If the version of Python is 3.9 or higher, you are good to go! If not, you will need to change the default python version by following the instructions in the "Troubleshooting" section below
4. Run `pip3 install tk`
5. Download [jan-ken-po.py](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mo_P5cTrWKnrpOcwWqWN2faYZoH84F9n/view?usp=sharing) and test if Tkinter works by running `python jan-ken-po.py` -- You should see an interface for playing Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer!

#### Troubleshooting
**Python version < 3.9:** If your Python version is something like `3.8.9`, we'll follow the instructions in [this article](https://opensource.com/article/19/5/python-3-default-mac) to upgrade the default Python version on your computer:
1. `brew install pyenv` install pyenv to manage different Python *env*ironments
2. `pyenv install 3.10.6` install python 3.10.6 using pyenv 
3. `pyenv global 3.10.6` set 3.10.6 to the default on your computer
4. `echo -e 'if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then\n  eval "$(pyenv init -)"\nfi' >> ~/.zshrc` to allow pyenv to control the python version during every terminal session
   1. If you get a "file not found" warning for ~/.zshrc, create the file with `touch ~/.zshrc`
5. `source ~/.zshrc` to apply your new settings
6. `python --version` test it! this should print `3.10.6`
