### Description
This is the repository containing code samples, tutorials, and project starters for the Intro to Computer Programming course at Nueva Upper School.

## Developer Environment Setup

1. **Download a code editor!** I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or [Atom](www.atom.io). A code editor is like a programmer's iron man suit - It's a text editor with a bunch of special tools programmers.
2. **Install Homebrew.** Homebrew is a package manager for Mac - it's like your personal code librarian. Instructions are also here: https://brew.sh/
   1. Open your Terminal (command + Space then type Terminal)
   2. Copy and paste the following in your Terminal `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"` then hit Return
   3. Enter your password and hit Return (your password will not show up when you type ðŸ™ƒ)
   4. Hit Return again (don't abort ðŸ˜¸)
   5. When Homebrew is done installing, you should see instructions to add the `% brew` command to your Terminal's path. Run the following command in your Terminal: `echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/<your username>/.zprofile
    eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"` and hit Return
3. **Install Python 3** by running `brew install python3` in your Terminal.
4. **Set Python 3 as your default Python version**
   1. Create a new file by running `vim ~/.bash_profile` in your Terminal
   2. Hit your "i" key to insert text and copy/paste the following in the new file: `alias python="python3"`
   3. Hit the "esc" key to exit insert mode, then type ":wq" (for "write and quit") then hit Return
   4. Finally, run `source ~/.bash_profile` in your Terminal
5. **Verify that things work!**
   1. Run `python -v` in your Terminal. You should see that Python 3.9.6 (or higher) is being currently used
   2. Run `brew help` in your Terminal. You should see the documentation of all brew commands!
   3. Look at [Troubleshooting](###Troubleshooting) below if these commands are not working as expected

#### Troubleshooting
```zsh: command not found: brew```
You need to add the `brew` command to your path, so that Terminal recognizes it! Run this is Terminal:
```
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/<your username>/.zprofile
    eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```
    
```/nofile.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory```
Make sure you are in the directory that your code lives in! You can use `cd <Directory name>` to go to another Directory in your current folder, or `cd ..` to move up a level in the file hierarchy.
    
## Project 1: Drawing with p5

We'll use p5 for our first project. This library is used for creating visual graphics. Some of you might be familiar with Processing, a visual graphics library in Javascript, and p5 was in fact originally built in Javascript before being translated to Python!

Let's get started by installing p5 on your machine. If you haven't followed the steps to install Homebrew and Python in the [Developer Environment Setup](##Developer Environment Setup) steps, do that **first**!

#### Installing p5
Open your Terminal. Run the following commands by typing them in Terminal, then hit Return.
1. `python3 --version` this should return `3.10.6`
2. `pip3 install --upgrade pip` to make sure you're on the latest version of the python package installer
2. `pip3 install p5` this will fail; thatâ€™s okay
2. `pip3 install numpy` This installs the latest version of numpy, which is a dependency for p5
3. `pip3 install freetype-py glfw pillow requests skia-python` This installs most of the dependencies that come after numpy
4. `pip3 install pyopengl`
5. `pip3 install vispy --user-deprecated=legacy-resolver`
6. `pip3 install p5 --no-deps`
7. **Test out that it works!** The p5 library offers many test examples that you can try out [here](https://github.com/p5py/p5-examples) - Bookmark it!
   1. Copy the code from [snake.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p5py/p5-examples/master/misc/games/snake.py)
   2. Create a new file in your Terminal `vim snake.py`
   3. Paste the code into the new snake.py file
   4. Hit "esc" and close by typing ":wq" and hitting Return
   5. Run the program by running `python3 snake.py` in Terminal
   6. You should get a popup window with the game - hit an arrow key on your keyboard to play!
